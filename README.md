## Andy Stearman's Front End Development Website Project
### My website is for the company, Echo. This is a space charter business.


*Feature Project Requirements On My Site:*
  
  **1. A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu)**
  
Responsive mobile-friendly hamburger menu that appears when screen size is less than 769px.
  
  **2. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes** 
  
I used flexbox on most of the site. There are multiple instances of rearanging rows/columns and images.
  
  **3. Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout** 

Used media queries to switch layout as screen size shrinks/expands. Mainly used min-width:769px and min-width:1030px.
     
  **4. Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format** 

There is a contact form at the bottom of the page that has multiple fields and validates input.
     
  **5. Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button).** 

The function I am referring to here might count for two requirements - this one and the image carousel. At the top of the page is an image slider. When you click the 'next' and 'previous' buttons it jumps between 5 different images. It does this by applying the class ".current" to each image. The images are all set to an opacity of 0 and when the 'next' or 'previous' button is clicked, it applies the class ".current", which changes the opacity to 1.
     
   **6. Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through** 

See #5 above
     
 **I am still hoping to add a few more features to the website before July 31st.**
